<h3>Travel light</h3>
<p>I travel with very little baggage.</p>
<ul>
<li>I typically travel with my backpack and a single small duffle that is small enough to count as a personal item &lt;link&gt; (though I&rsquo;m using it as my carryon). I keep the duffle packed, and ready to go, so that I&rsquo;m equipped with all the peripherals I want to travel with, even if I have 0 time to pack.</li>
<li>I basically never check bags.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prioritize high-quality sleep over reducing travel time</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s work that I can do on planes, as long as I&rsquo;m well rested. So I generally don&rsquo;t try to minimize the time that I&rsquo;m on a plane or in the airport. Instead I focus on maximizing the amount of time that I&rsquo;m alert and well-rested.</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, when selecting flights, choose flights that allow me to get a full night sleep the night before.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When I have an early flight out of SFO, I&rsquo;ll book an airbnb right next to the airport, and sleep there the night before.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This means that I can sleep in for an extra 45 minutes (the time that it would otherwise take me to uber to the airport in the morning).&nbsp;</li>
<li>And because I&rsquo;m not time-pressured, I can take the BART to get down there instead of an uber. So although I&rsquo;m paying $80 for a room, this is displacing ~$60 that I otherwise would pay for a rideshare from Berkeley to SFO. So I&rsquo;m on net paying ~$30 for being able to sleep somewhat longer (after accounting for the shorter uber ride to the airport from the airBnB).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When I travel to Europe, I&rsquo;ll often break long travel days into two easier travel days. Instead of booking a connecting flight to the city to which I&rsquo;m traveling, I&rsquo;ll book a flight to some city in Europe (often in England), an airbnb right next to the airport, and a flight to my final destination for the next day.</li>
<ul>
<li>This way, instead of having a 17 or 18 hour travel day, I&rsquo;ll have a 10 hour travel day, collapse in exhaustion, sleep in a real bed, awake well rested, and then have another (usually shorter) travel day.</li>
</ul>
<li>when traveling to Europe, I&rsquo;ll sometimes adjust my schedule to close-to-UK-time, before I leave. I&rsquo;ll stay up later and later each night, shifting to a mostly nocturnal schedule where I&rsquo;m waking up at 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon, local time. I&rsquo;ll book the latest international flight I can get. So the day before my flight, I go to sleep at 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning, wake up in the evening, and immediately go to the airport. While most of my co-passengers are sleeping on the plane, I have an alert, focused day of work. I&rsquo;ll have an extra long travel day, and go to sleep in the late afternoon of my destination time&rsquo;s zone. I&rsquo;ll sleep for unusually long and wake up in the early morning of my local timezone.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
