		<h1>Statement on cryonics</h1>

<div class="main text">
	<div>
    <p>I am currently signed up for neuropreservation through Alcor, funded by a </p>

    <p>My primary motivation for cryonics is preserving optionality. I find it pretty plausible that the equibirium of philosophical reflection
        will conclude what is valuble is conciousness-moments, rather than people. It might turn out that there isn't a meaningful
        difference between there being experience moments that have continuity of identity with "me", and there being equally meaningful 
        experience-moments that don't, in which case cryonics doesn't buy me anything.

    <p><b>However</b>, I absolutely do not want to make irreversable decisions (like allowing myself to die irretrivably), on the basis
        of my current, non-equibibrium, philosophical intuitions, generated by my monkey brain in an infant society. I want to punt 
        questions to the future where (if things go well), I, and society, will be much smarter and much better informed, and can have much 
        more confidence in our philosophy. Cryonics is the action that preserves options for my future self, while regular death doesn't.
    
    </p>

    <p>I haven't looked into the technology in that much detail, but it seems like a pretty good bet that cyronics
        <i>can</i> work: that there's a greater than 30% chance that cryopreservation preserves what's important about a 
        person's soul such that the technology of the future can bring them back.
    </p>

    <p>However, my best guess is that cryonics will not work actually work, because humanity will go extinct before revival
        is possible. (I decline to give a specific probability estimate of extinction.)</p>        
    </p>
    
    <p>It seems pretty likely that important soul-relevant information is stored in parts of the body other than the brain,
        in neural tissue, or in other body systems. My prefered cryopreservation method would be to sever and preserve the head,
        and then also preserve the body, seperately. As far as I know, no cryonics organization currently offers this, but I might
        look into trying to set that up as a custom arrangement with Alcor, when I'm older and richer.
    </p>

    <p>When I was younger, I had a rule that for every dollar I spent for myself (which in practice mostly meant purchacing
        personal development materials), I would donate an equal amount to charity. I dropped this policy when I discovered x-risk,
        deciding that I should be much more unreserved about investing in my own capabilities. Cryonics is the only major 
        (greater than >$1000 a year) purchace that is clearly just for me: my being cryopreserved does not improve the world or
        increase my own capability to improve the world. </p>

        
    <p>So, I apply my old policy for spending money. I now donate $<text id="total cost"></text> a year (the total cost of my life insurance and Alcor fees, as of <text id="current year"></text> ), to 
        near-termist charaties.
