</h4><p><a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com">Musings and Rough Drafts</a> is my personal blog, where I write about whatever is of interest to me at the moment, with wildly varying levels of rigor and polish. Some people have expressed that they found it helpful to them.</p>
<p>I also post on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/elityre">Less Wrong</a>.</p>
<p>I also sometimes write threads on twitter, where my handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/EpistemicHope">@EpistemicHope</a>. I archive virtually all my threads on <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/user/EpistemicHope">threadreader</a>, so you can read them without needing to wade into <a href="twitter-policy.html">an attention-harvesting, intention-sapping, social media platform</a>.</p>

</h4><p>I&rsquo;m a mediocre software engineer, mostly building tools for my own use. My open sourced projects are <a href="https://github.com/Etyre">here</a>.</p>

</h4><p>I have a <a href="https://twitter.com/epistemichope/status/1341579932963487745">standing interest</a> in participating in short (1 to 10 hour), adversarial collaborations. If you think I&rsquo;m mistaken about something and want to hash it out with me, let me know. I&rsquo;m probably down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not under a secret NDA that I can&rsquo;t even mention exists</p>
