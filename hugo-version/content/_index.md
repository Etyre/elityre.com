# About

This is the personal website of Eli Tyre.

I am a generalist and independent scholar, currently based in Berkeley, California (but I travel a lot).

I hustle, with the aim of improving the chances that human civilization survives this century, so that we have enough time to figure out how to build a Good (e.g. sane, safe, humane, psychologically-healthy, eudemonic) society. Professionally, I do freelance work with small selection of organizations taking action to reduce [existential-risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk#:~:text=An%20event%20that%20could%20cause,of%20a%20major%20asteroid%20impact.).

<!--
I have additional personal/profesional interests in

- innovations in governance or collective decision-making
- electoral reform
- learning and performance psychology,

<!--
Some of my contraian beliefs:

- There's a greater than 10% chance that humanity will be extinct by the year 2050 due to a mishandled AI transition.
- You should sign up for cryonics. It might save your life, and it's good for the world. I'm personally signed up with alcor.
- I don't know if most people should be vegan, but I strongly belive that anyone making more than $x a year should abstain from factory farmed meat.
- The impact of the internet is overrated compared to other technological transitions like electrification, automobiles, and industrialization.

<!-- I want to include some facutal claims, such as thing about the great depresion or about chemistry or history. -->

#### Writing

[Musings and Rough Drafts](https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com) is my personal blog, where I write about whatever is of interest to me at the moment, with wildly varying levels of rigor and polish. Some people have expressed that they found it helpful to them.

I also post on [Less Wrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/elityre).

I also sometimes write threads on twitter, where my handle is [@EpistemicHope](https://twitter.com/EpistemicHope). I archive virtually all my threads on [threadreader](https://threadreaderapp.com/user/EpistemicHope), so you can read them without needing to wade into [an attention-harvesting, intention-sapping, social media platform](twitter-policy.html).

#### Software

I'm a mediocre software engineer, mostly building tools for my own use. My open sourced projects are [here](https://github.com/Etyre).

#### Adversarial collaborations

I have a [standing interest](https://twitter.com/epistemichope/status/1341579932963487745) in participating in short (1 to 10 hour), adversarial collaborations. If you think I'm mistaken about something and want to hash it out with me, let me know. I'm probably down.

I'm not under a secret NDA that I can't even mention exists
