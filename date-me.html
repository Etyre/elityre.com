	<!--I think that I need to rewrite this to be more...gentle?-->

	<p>I'm a straight (if asexual-leaning) man, single and seeking.</p>

	<p>Ultimately, I’m looking for a sort of <i>spiritual comradeship</i>. Partership with a person who is relentlessly dedicated to making
	the world bright, and who is aiming to face up to their own demons and weaknesses, to better live with integrity and be a force for light 
	in the world, and who will help me do the same.</p> 

	<p>But for the time being, I’m just wanting more female companionship in my life. I would like to spend more time with women that I like. It would be great to be able to hang out with someone on the order of once a week, cuddling and talking, being curious together, and maybe strength training and co-working, with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other.</p>

	<p> I'm told that I'm pretty much the same in person as online, so if you like my writing (and present as female), there's a reasonable chance we would "click" romantically.
	If you're interested or possibly-interested in going on a low-key date, fill out
