	<p>I’m seeking a long term partner and spiritual colaborator: Someone seriously committed to...</p> 
	<ul> 
		<li>1) making the world much brighter, however they can,</li> 
		<li>2) maintaining accurate beliefs, and </li>
		<li>3) to their own personal growth 
	</ul> 
	<p>...who can help me do all of the above better, and would like to be helped by me in turn. </p>

<p> Aside from that, I’m also interested in spending time with women who I might have interesting conversations with, even if it doesn’t seem likely to lead to a long term partnership.</p>

<p>If you present as female, and are interested or possibly-interested in going on a low-key date, fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSck4u2hYoXpkPkWxVxUPavsABD40I8EXhhEJBNfHKVzCHEJpg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this</a> google form, and maybe we can meet up the next time we’re in the same metropolitan area.</p>
