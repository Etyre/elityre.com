	<!--I think that I need to rewrite this to be more...gentle?-->
	
	<p>I'm a straight man, seeking romantic companionship. I'm told that I'm pretty much the same in person as online, so if you like my writing (and present as female), there's a reasonable chance we would "click" romantically.
	
	<p>I’m seeking a long term partner and spiritual colaborator: Someone seriously committed...</p> 
	<ul> 
		<li>1) to making the world much brighter, however they can,</li> 
		<li>2) to maintaining accurate beliefs, and </li>
		<li>3) to their own personal growth 
	</ul> 
	<p>...who can help me do all of the above better, and would like to be helped by me in turn. </p>

	<p> However, <i>aside</i> from that, I’m also interested in spending time with women who I might have interesting conversations with, even if it doesn’t seem likely to lead to that sort of commited partnership.</p>

<p>If you're interested or possibly-interested in going on a low-key date, fill out <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSck4u2hYoXpkPkWxVxUPavsABD40I8EXhhEJBNfHKVzCHEJpg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this google form</a></b>, and maybe we can meet up the next time we’re in the same metropolitan area.</p>
