		<h1>Veganism policy</h1>

<div class="main text">
	<div>
    <p>I am vegan, with some caveats listed below.</p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>I take suplements of grass-fed beef orffal every day.</li>
            <li>I take fish oil supplements, every day.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Factory Farming is incredibly and transparently evil, and I do not want to subsidize it or in any way perpetuate it. Not eating industrial meat seems to me to be
        about as straightforward an ethical injunction as not not participating in the slave-holding system of the the American Antebellum south (one of the most unethical 
        manifestations of slavery ever practiced on planet earth). </p>
        
        <p>The only mitigating factor is some uncertainty about the conciousness of the relevant animals. From my epistemic vantage point, I have no strong reason to think
            that pigs, cows, and pultry, in particular, <em>don't</em> experience pain and terror. I fall back on an uncertain prior, which is sufficient justification to
            hold off on torturing them.</p>
    

    <p>I'm overall not opposed to raising animals to have happy lives in humane circumstances and killing them to eat, though I think I probably prefer food production that 
        doesn't create and terminate concious entities at all.</p>
    
    <p>I've been vegitarian since I was 15, originally because I reasoned that I didn't care if something ate me after I died,
        but I did have a preference that I not be killed to be eaten, and thought that I should extend the same courtsy to other animals.
        (Also, I had read that Atlanten priests were vegitarians, which also influenced me.) 
        I have an allergy to milk, so I was functionally ovo-vegetarian. Around 2018, I started adding a small amount of meat back into my diet out of nutritional 
        concerns. I became as fully vegan as I am now around 2021.</p>
