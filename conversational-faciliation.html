		<h> Conversational Faciliation, Disagrement-Resolution, and Discourse </h>

		<p>I've spent several years studying, developing, and iterating on methods for effective communication, and especially, for bridging deep, seemingly-intractable, differences in worldviews or ontologies. You can find writeups of some of the specific techniques, frameworks, and discourse norms, that I rely on and recomend here and here. Additionaly some examples of my conversational aproach can be found in my conversations on twitter, or on my youtube channel. I regularly offer mediation for resolving tricky disagreements, or other difficult conversations. If you think you might benefit from that I occassionally offer training in the methods that I understand well enough to teach. If you're interested in that, sign up for this mailing list.</p>
