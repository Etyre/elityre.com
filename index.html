  <h2>Conversational Faciliation, Disagrement-Resolution, and Discourse</h2>
  
I've spent several years studying, developing, and iterating on methods for effective communication, and especially, for bridging deep, seemingly-intractable, differences in worldviews or ontologies.
  
  You can find writeups of some of the specific techniques, frameworks, and discourse norms, that I rely on and recomend here and here.
  
  Additionaly some examples of my conversational aproach can be found in my conversations on twitter, or on my youtube channel.
  
  I regularly offer mediation for resolving tricky disagreements, or other difficult conversations. If you think you might benefit from that
  
  I occassionally offer training in the methods that I understand well enough to teach. If you're interested in that, sign up for this mailing list.
