	<p> This is the personal website of Eli Tyre.</p>
		
	<p>I am an indpendent scholar, currently based in Berkeley, California.</p>
	
	<h2>Strategy</h2>
	
	<p> My main, and most, important work is my research and writing on global strategy, trying to get a grasp on what is happening in the world that matters in the long run, and what paths exist for humanity surviving the past 2200 and going on to create a safe, sane, civilization. 
	
	<!--<p>Most of that work is collected on my blog Heart Head Horizon, with some of it crosposted to LessWrong.</p>
	
	<p>I also have a podcast, "Plans and Actions" in which I interview people about their plans to radically improve the world. </p>-->
	
	<h2>Discourse</h2>
	
	<p> Since 2016, I've spent a consistent chunk of effort studying and developing effective discourse methods, especially methods for espistemically resolving thorny disagreements and bridging deep differences in worldviews. <p> 

	<!--<p> I have a podcast, Cooperative Curiosity, in which I both participate in and mediate good faith (if sometimes heated) conversations, on important topics, between people who strongly disagree, with the aim of both understanding the other's perspective, and actually clarifying what's true.</p>
	<p>I also own a small consulting company, Epistemic Mediation, that offers conversational facilitation services, for both private important conversations within an org, and for enabling effective communication across intellectual cultures.</p>
	    
	<p>There's some writing on my converstational methodologies on LessWrong, but I think that writing rarely conveys the "sense" of those methods, and the podcast is a better place to start. </p> -->
	
	<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
	
	<p><a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/">Musings and Rough Drafts</a> is where I post my even-less-polished-than-usual, unrigorous and stream of conciousness thinking. Mostly it seems to be about sociological and cultural trends. </p>
	
	<p> I'm a mediocre software engineer and I mostly build tools for myself. But you're welcome to check out my github account, if you want.
		
	<p> Over the years, I've explored and experimented all kinds of personal development interventions, especially strategies for efficient learning and maintaining high throughput, and trying to tease out the underlying psychological mechanisms of the things that work. <a href="https://efficacyengineering.wordpress.com/">Efficacy Engineering</a> is my applied psychology blog / wiki, where I outline my current systems for intentionality and productivity, document some of my learning projects as I go, and use .</a>
