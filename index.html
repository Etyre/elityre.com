	<p>I’ve been focused on reducing existential risk from Superintelligence since 2015. I work hard, with the aim of improving the chances that human civilization survives this century, so that we have enough time to figure out how to build a Good (e.g. sane, safe, humane, psychologically-healthy, eudemonic) society. </p>
		
	<!-- <p>I have additional personal/profesional interests in </p>
	<ul>
		<li>innovations in governance or collective decision-making</li>
		<li>electoral reform</li>
		<li>learning and performance psychology, </li>
	</ul>	 -->

	<!-- <p>Some of my contraian beliefs:</p>

	 <ul>
		<li>There's a greater than 10% chance that humanity will be extinct by the year 2050 due to a mishandled AI transition.</li>
		<li>You should sign up for cryonics. It might save your life, and it's good for the world. I'm personally signed up with alcor.</li>
		<li>I don't know if most people should be vegan, but I strongly belive that anyone making more than $x a year should abstain from factory farmed meat.</li> 
		<li>The impact of the internet is overrated compared to other technological transitions like electrification, automobiles, and industrialization.

	<H4>Institutional affiliation(s)</H4>

	<p>I am the project lead at <a href="https://palisaderesearch.org/about">Palisade Research</a>, focused on briefing policymakers and the public about the imminent intelligence explosion.</p>

	<p>I additionally work part time for <a href="https://survivalandflourishing.fund/">the Survival and Flourishing Fund</a>, coordinating x-risk focused grant rounds.</p>

	
	<H4>Writing</H4>

	<p><a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com">Musings and Rough Drafts</a> is my personal blog, where I write about whatever is of interest to me at the moment, with wildly varying levels of rigor and polish. Some people have expressed that they found it helpful to them.</p>
		
	<p>I also post on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/elityre">Less Wrong</a>.</p> 
		
	<p>I also sometimes write threads on twitter, where my handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/EpistemicHope">@EpistemicHope</a>. I archive virtually all my threads on
	<a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/user/EpistemicHope">threadreader</a>, so you can read them without needing to wade into <a href="twitter-policy.html">an attention-harvesting, intention-sapping, social media platform</a>.</p> 
	
	<H4>Software</H4>

	<p>I'm a mediocre software engineer, mostly building tools for my own use. My open sourced projects are <a href="https://github.com/Etyre">here</a>.</p>
	
	<H4>Adversarial collaborations</H4>

	<p>I have a <a href="https://twitter.com/epistemichope/status/1341579932963487745">standing interest</a> in participating in short (1 to 10 hour), adversarial collaborations. If you think I'm mistaken about something and want to hash it out with me, let me know. I'm probably down.</p>

	<p> I’m not under a secret NDA that I can’t even mention exists</p>


	<!-- <h2>Long-termist Strategy</h2>
	
	<p> My main, and most important, work is my research and writing on global strategy: attempting to get a grasp on which global trends matter in the historical long run, and to identify paths that will result in humanity surviving this current century and going on to create a safe, sane, humane, civilization. </p>
	
	<p>Currently, most of my public work on this kind of thing is either on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/elityre">LessWrong</a>, or under the <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/category/macro-strategy/">Macro-strategy</a> and <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/category/applied-philosophy-and-decision-theory-of-saving-the-world/">Applied Philosophy and Decision Theory of Saving the World</a> categories on <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/"> Musings and Rough Drafts</a>. I have vague plans to start a dedicated blog for this.
		
	<p>Most of that work is collected on my blog Heart Head Horizon, with some of it crosposted to LessWrong.</p>
	
	<p>I also have a podcast, "Plans and Actions" in which I interview people about their plans to radically improve the world. </p>
	
	<h2>Discourse</h2>
	
	<p>I think a lot about the difficulties of human communication, how it goes wrong, and how to do better. I'm especially interested in problem of bridging ontological divides: how to resolve disagreements and make epistemic progress across radically differences in ontology and worldview.</p> 
	
	<p>There are a few (disorganized, unedited) examples of my attempting to do this on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyH9KF8hrD8SjXWHz4cJIGA">YouTube channel</a>. You can find some of my public writing on this topic <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/category/conversational-faciliation/">here</a>and here(link to a lessWrong double crux sequence). More on this coming soon.</p> -->


	<!--<p> I have a podcast, Cooperative Curiosity, in which I both participate in and mediate good faith (if sometimes heated) conversations, on important topics, between people who strongly disagree, with the aim of both understanding the other's perspective, and actually clarifying what's true.</p>
	
	<p>I also own a run Epistemic Mediation which offers conversational facilitation services, for both private important conversations within an org, and for enabling effective communication across intellectual cultures.</p>
	    
	<p>There's some writing on my converstational methodologies on LessWrong, but I think that writing rarely conveys the "sense" of those methods, and the podcast is a better place to start. </p> -->
	
	<!-- <h2>Applied Psychology <!--/ Learning Theory and Productivity--></h2>
		
	<!-- <p> Over the years, I've explored and experimented with all kinds of personal development interventions, especially strategies for efficient learning and maintaining high throughput, 
		and then trying to tease out the underlying psychological mechanisms of the things that work.</p>
	
	<p><a href="https://efficacyengineering.wordpress.com/">Efficacy Engineering</a> is 
		my applied psychology blog and wiki, where I host outlines of my current systems, document some of my learning / meta-learning projects in real time, and generally
		try to iterate to a more true and useful ontology of these domains.</p>
