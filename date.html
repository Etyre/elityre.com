	<!--I think that I need to rewrite this to be more...gentle?-->

	<p>I'm a straight (if asexual-leaning) man, single and seeking. I was born in 1994.</p>
	
	<h2>What I Want</h2>

	<p>Ultimately, I’m looking for a sort of <i>spiritual comradeship</i>. Partership with a person who is relentlessly dedicated to making
	the world bright, who is striving to face up to her own demons, to better live in integrity and more efffectively be a force for light 
	in the world, and who will help me in doing the same. I want a partner who inspires me to be better.</p> <!--too many "ands"-->

	<p>But for the time being, I’m just wanting more female companionship in my life; I would like to spend more time with women I like. 
		
	<p>More specifcially, it would be great to have someone to spend time with on the order of once a week, cuddling and talking, being curious together, and maybe co-working or strength training, with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other.</p>

	<p>And, especially while I'm traveling, I'm pretty glad to go on causual dates with anyone who thinks "teaching each other things that one of us understands" or "trying together to puzzle out something that neither of us understands", is a good first date, even if it doesn't seem likely to lead to any kind of relationship.</p>

	<h2>Interested?</h2>
	
	<p>If you're interested or possibly-interested in any of that, you can fill out 
	<b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSck4u2hYoXpkPkWxVxUPavsABD40I8EXhhEJBNfHKVzCHEJpg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this google form</a></b>, and maybe we can meet in-person the next time we’re in the same metropolitan area.</p>
	
	<p>(Filling out the form is in no way a commitment, either from you or for me, which does mean that this takes a bit of courage. I'm greatful to everyone who goes for it anyway, even if it turns out we're not a good match. TDT-wise, your doing that is the only reason this systems works at all. So thank you.)</p> 

	<p>If you would like more detail, about who I am, or what I'm looking for, <a href="https://www.okcupid.com/profile/6765423466650624251">this</a> is an old okcupid profile of mine. However, I think you might get a less biased and more up-to-date picture of me by reading my <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/user/EpistemicHope">twitter threads</a> or my blogs.</p>
