	<!--I think that I need to rewrite this to be more...gentle?-->

	<p>I'm a straight (if asexual-leaning) man, single and seeking. I was born in 1994.</p>
	
	<h2>What I Want</h2>
	<h3>Long term</h3>

	<p>Ultimately, I’m looking for a sort of <i>spiritual collaboration</i>. A Partership with someone relentlessly dedicated to improving the world, who is striving to face up to her own demons in order better live in integrity and more efffectively be a force for light 
	in the universe. And who will support me in doing the same.  
	
	<p>I want a partner who inspires me to be better than I am.</p> <!--too many "ands"-->
	
	<h3>Medium term</h3>

	<p><!--But that is a long term aim.-->But, for the time being, I’m just looking more female companionship in my life: I would like to spend more time with women I like. 
		
	<p>More specifcially, it would be great to have someone to hang out with on the order of once a week: cuddling and talking, being curious together, and maybe co-working or strength training, with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other.</p>

	<p>And, especially while I'm traveling, I'm glad to go on casual dates with anyone who thinks "teaching each other about things tha one of us doesn't know about" or "trying together to puzzle out something that neither of us understands", is a good first date, even if it doesn't seem likely to lead to any kind of long term relationship.</p>
	
	<h2>Constraints and deal-breakers</h2>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>I am highly committed to my work. I think that the world is currently in a precarious state, moving in the direction of disaster, and that I personally stand any chance at all of doing something about that.</p> 

<p>As such, I work hard, and I spend the majority of my waking hours sequestered in my office.</p> 

<p>Anyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with that, either because they have a similar orientation to the world themselves, or because they’re chill with a relationship that is intimate, without being time-intensive.</p> 

<h3>Honesty</h3>
<p>The thing that is most important to me in all of my personal relationships is skilled honesty. </p>

<p>I’ve sometimes been in contexts where there was something important that I felt like I “wasn’t allowed to say” for some reason or another. (Because it would offend someone, or because it “wasn’t my place”, or because pointing out some farce would make things worse, or something else.)</p>

<p>I’ve come to think that you can’t build anything robust on a foundation of this kind of holding back. I want to participate in contexts where I can be fully honest, and it is safe and practical for people to be fully honest with me, upto and including the the all of things that usually it is not polite or acceptable to say.</p>

<p>I make explicit, considered, effort, in all my important relationships, to build an API such that the two of us can say anything (including our judgements, frustrations, and deep feedback), in a way that the other party can hear it, without feeling attacked. And I’ve sought to develop the skills to support this kind of honesty, circling skill, NVC, and rationality.</p>

<p>It is important to me that, between the two of us, we have enough skill to maintain this kind of connection: That it continues to feel possible, for you and for me, to share what’s up for us, even if that is uncomfortable or impolite or awkward.</p>
</p>
	

<h3>Relationship style</h3>

<p>I care about feeling secure in my relationship with my partner, and knowing that she values me in a stable more-or-less non-fungible way. Aside from that, I am glad for my partner to have other partners, short term or long term, if that lights her up.</p>  

<p>Personally, I’m pretty monogamous by nature, in that I don’t have much desire for more than one partner. That said, my sense of how I relate to romance has shifted over the past few years, so maybe this will shift too.</p> 

<h3>Kids</h3>

<p>I’m undecided about having kids. I’m not currently planning around having a family, but I would if I found a highly compatible partner, and it was important to her. (That is conditional on having enough money, and being part of a healthy enough community that we could raise and educate them well, but I’m optimistic on both fronts.)</p> 
	
	<p>That is to say, I am <em>open</em> to having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.</p>

<p>I do have strong feelings about genomic selection: if I have kids at all, I am adamant about using whatever technologies are available at the time to increase their life-long health and intelligence.</p> 

	
	
	<h2>Interested?</h2>
	
	<p>If any of the above seems good to you, and you want to explore further, feel free to <a href="contact.html">send me a message</a>, saying so. Or, if you don't know where to start, you can fill out
	<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSck4u2hYoXpkPkWxVxUPavsABD40I8EXhhEJBNfHKVzCHEJpg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this google form</a>, instead. Maybe we can meet in-person the next time we’re in the same metropolitan area.</p>
	
	<p>I'm greatful to everyone who takes initiative and reaches out, even if it turns out we're not a good match. TDT-wise, your doing that is the only reason this system works at all. So thank you. : ) </p> 

	<p>If you would like more detail about who I am, or what I care about, <a href="https://www.okcupid.com/profile/6765423466650624251">this</a> is an old okcupid profile of mine. However, I think you might get a less biased and more up-to-date picture of me by reading my <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/user/EpistemicHope">twitter threads</a> or my <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/">blog</a>.</p>

	<p><b>Some friends' descriptions of me:</b>


<p>Friend 1: <em>"Erudite, stoic, and unrelentingly devoted to good. Also a little bit clumsy, but you can leave that part out.”</em></p>

<p>Friend 2: <em> "Human, on the lower end of height but upper percentage of brain capacity with a weird interest in saying true things, keeping commitments, and deliberately practicing skills he wants to get good at."</em></p>

<p>Friend 3: <em>“Eli is kind of what you would imagine a human might be like if you hadn't met any humans but had built a lot of houses.”</em></p>
