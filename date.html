	<h2>What I Want</h2>
	<h3>Long term</h3>

	<p>Ultimately, I’m looking for a sort of <i>spiritual collaboration</i>. A partnership with someone relentlessly and ambitiously dedicated to improving the world, who is striving <!--to face up to her own demons, -->to grow in skill and wisdom, in order <!--better live in integrity and--> more effectively be a force for light 
	in the universe, who will support me in doing the same. We work to make each other stronger. And we face the world together. (Some more operationalization <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZikhCHkCsii2ecOAlZG4UO4o2xXVLz7DYIjebmE0K0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.)</p>

	
	<p>I want a partner who inspires me to be better than I am.</p>
	
	<!--<p>I have wanted something like this since I first booted up into a self-reflective, self-modifying loop at around 15.
	I think, that this is what I will ultimately want. However, currently I'm focusing on setting up my life and work to be stable without the support of
	a deep partnership. This is not the <em>main</em> thing I'm looking for at the moment, though I would be remiss not to at least mention this, in case a compatible person comes along.</p> -->
	
	<h3>Medium term</h3>

	<p><!--But that is a long term aim.-->But, for the time being, I’m looking more female companionship in my life.<!--: I would like to spend more time with women I like.--> 
		
	<p>It would be great to have someone to hang out with on the order of once a week: talking, being curious together, circling a lot, co-working or strength training, maybe cuddling, with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other.</p>

	<!--<p>In practice, this mostly entails hanging out a few times a week in the afternoon / early evening (in between my main work periods) to go on a walk or a hike, or coworking on tasks together in the evening to midnight. </p>-->

	<p>And, especially while I'm traveling, I'm glad to go on casual dates with anyone who thinks "sharing something one of us learned recently" or "trying to puzzle something out together" is a good first date, even if it doesn't seem likely to lead to any kind of long term relationship.</p>
	
	<!--<h4>What Dating Me Is Like</h4>-->
	
	<h4>Dates</h4>
	
	<p>Here are some activities that are my idea of a "good date". You don't have to be into all of these, just one of them.<p>
	
    <ul>
	<li>The uncomplicated default: We go on a walk (maybe into the hills, if we're in Berkeley) and talk, about life, about the world, about what we've been thinking about lately, about who and where we are and how we got there.</li>
    <li> We try to make progress on some problem of yours. I listen, and try to help you solve it. Or, if there's something that you're trying to do or learn, and I try to help you get unstuck.</li> 
    <li>We spend a half day trying to get a grip on something neither of us know anything about. (ie How do mitocondria work? How do you build a computer from logic gates? What's the deal with Modern Monetary Theory? How does the math of predictive processing work?)</li>
    <!--<li>We play around with some kind of new-to-us skill or modality (eg things like fermi estimates, or IFS, or vibe-reading, if any of those were new to me), and tinker to try and find functional-for-each-of-us versions.</li>-->
	    
	    <!--<li>We make the world better somehow. When I was yonger, I had a policy of always going volunteering for first dates. But -->
	    
	  </ul>
	    
	    <p>Also, if there's some activity that is wildly unlike these, but which you want to do together, suggest it! I'm generally up for trying things.</p>
	
	<h2>Constraints and deal-breakers</h2>

	<h3>Work</h3>

	<p>I am highly committed to my work. I think that the world is currently in a precarious state, moving in the direction of disaster, and that I personally stand any chance at all of doing something about that.</p> 

	<p>As such, I work hard, and I spend the majority of my waking hours sequestered in my office.</p> 

	<p>Anyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with that, either because they have a similar orientation to the world themselves, or because they’re chill with a relationship that is intimate, without being time-intensive.</p> 

	<h3>Honesty</h3>
	<p>The thing that is most important to me in all of my personal relationships is skilled honesty. </p>

	<p>I’ve sometimes been in contexts where there was something important that I felt like I “wasn’t allowed to say” for some reason or another. (Because it would offend someone, or because it “wasn’t my place”, or because pointing out some farce would make things worse, or something else.)</p>

	<p>I’ve come to think that you can’t build anything robust on a foundation of this kind of holding back. I want to participate in contexts where I can be fully honest, and it is safe and practical for people to be fully honest with me, upto and including all of things that it is usually not polite or acceptable to say.</p>

	<p>Creating those kinds of contexts by main force isn't sustainable. It requires skill to say the things that can't usually be said, in a way that doesn't break everything.</p>	

	<p>I make explicit, considered, effort, in all my important relationships, to build an API such that the two of us can say anything (including our judgements, frustrations, and deep feedback), in a way that the other party can hear it, without feeling attacked. And I’ve sought to develop the skills to support this kind of honesty, circling skill, NVC, and rationality.</p>

	<p>It is important to me that, between the two of us, we have enough skill to maintain this kind of connection: that it continues to feel possible, for you and for me, to share what’s up for us, even if that is uncomfortable or impolite or awkward.</p>
	</p>

	<!--<p>Maybe you do this in some very different way than I do, but familiarity with Circling and NVC, a developed introspective access, skills related to making space for / owning your triggers, and a basic "desire to relate to what's true", are all good signs.</p>-->


	<h3>Relationship style</h3>

	<p>I care about feeling secure in my relationship with my partner, and knowing that she values me in a stable more-or-less non-fungible way. Aside from that, I am glad for my partner to have other partners, short term or long term, if that lights her up.</p>  

	<p>Personally, I’m pretty monogamous by nature, in that I don’t have much desire for more than one partner. (That said, my sense of how I relate to romance has shifted over the past few years, so maybe this will shift too.)</p> 

	<h3>Kids</h3>

	<p>I’m undecided about having kids. I’m not currently planning around having a family, but I would if I found a <i>highly</i> compatible partner, and it was important to her.**</p> 

		<p>That is to say, I am <em>open</em> to having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.</p>

	<p>I do have strong feelings about genomic selection: if I have kids at all, I am adamant about using whatever technologies are available at the time to increase their life-long health and intelligence.</p>

	<p>** - This is conditional on having enough money, and being part of a healthy enough community, that we could raise and educate kids well, but I think I'm on a good trajectory on both those fronts, and don't expect either money or community to be the limiting considerations.</p>


		<!--<h3>Height</h3> 

		<p>I’m pretty short for an American man (around 5’4”), though I am fit and muscular.</p> 

	<p>Insofar as height is something that my partner might care about, I’m sorry that I can't offer this. I would change it if I could, but tbe relevant biotechnology is not yet advanced enough (and probably won't be in the next 20 years).</p>-->

	<h3>Sex</h3>
	
	<p>Sex is not a priority for me. I would like to have sex with my partner, but if she doesn't want that or can't, that's not a deal-breaker for me.</p> 
	
	<h2>Some friends' descriptions of me:</h2>


<p>Friend 1: <em>"Erudite, stoic, and unrelentingly devoted to good. Also a little bit clumsy, but you can leave that part out.”</em></p>

<p>Friend 2: <em> "Human, on the lower end of height but upper percentage of brain capacity with a weird interest in saying true things, keeping commitments, and deliberately practicing skills he wants to get good at."</em></p>

<p>Friend 3: <em>“Eli is kind of what you would imagine a human might be like if you hadn't met any humans but had built a lot of houses.”</em></p>
		

	
	<h2>Interested?</h2>
	
	<p>If any of the above seems good to you, and you want to explore further, feel free to <a href="contact.html">send me a message</a> saying so. Or, if you don't know where to start, you can fill out
	<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSck4u2hYoXpkPkWxVxUPavsABD40I8EXhhEJBNfHKVzCHEJpg/viewform?usp=sf_link">this google form</a>, instead. Maybe we can meet in-person the next time we’re in the same metropolitan area.</p>
	
	<p>I'm grateful to everyone who takes initiative and reaches out, even if it turns out we're not a good match. TDT-wise, your doing that is the only reason this system works at all. So thank you. : ) </p> 

	<p>If you would like more detail about who I am, or what I care about, <a href="https://www.okcupid.com/profile/6765423466650624251">this</a> is an old okcupid profile of mine. However, I think you might get a less biased and more up-to-date picture of me by reading my <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/user/EpistemicHope">twitter threads</a> or my <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.wordpress.com/">blog</a>.</p>

	<h2>Aid my quest!</h2>

<p>If you’re not a good match with me for any reason (you’re male, or married, or want something different than I do), but you still like to help this project succeed, the main thing you can do is help me connect with people who might be compatible.</p>

<p>If you took even 5 minutes right now, to flip through your facebook friends, and consider if any of them might like to be introduced to me, you will earn my gratitude. Also, if you do introduce me to someone that I end up dating, you’ll earn not just my gratitude, but <a href="bounties.html">a $2000 dollar bounty</a>.</p>

	<h3>What sort of person am I looking for?</h3>

<p>This section is all the way down here, at the bottom of the page, because it’s mostly not relevant for people reading to see if they if they might want to go on a date with me. If they feel excited by the sort of interactions that I describe, I don’t want to discourage them because they don’t embody the traits I outline here.</p>

<p>However, for third parties who are hoping to help play match-maker, the above is a bit...abstract.</p>

<p>So the following are some more concrete traits, that empirically, in my life so far, have been predictive of people that I have liked and/or loved. These are not “standards”, in the sense of characteristics that I insist on in a partner, but rather characteristics or traits that are shared by many of the women I most like spending time with.</p>

<p>If you happen to know someone who is well described by the following, you might be doing us both a favor by, introing us, or sending her a link to this page.</p>

	<h4>Empirical predictors of the kinds of people Eli wants to date</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Female, in roughly my age range.</li>
	<li>Unusually ethical. Committed to making the world right, or fair, or good, or much better than it currently is.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The sort of person who, at some point in her life, thought that / planned to give away most of her income to charity.</li>

		<li>Probably vegan or vegetarian.</li>
			
		</ul>

	<li>Works a lot. Is the sort of person who might be described as a workaholic. </li>

	<li>Thoughtful, and puts her thought into practice. <!--[Can I elaborate this? Exmaples would be helpful. --></li>

	<li>Intelligent.</li> 
	<ul>
		<li>In particular, possessing impressive verbal fluency. She's self assured and fast on her feet in conversation. </li>
			
		</ul>
		
	<li>Might be described as conventionally "pretty". (I feel a bit embarrased about including this, because it seems like a sad fact about the world that people's non-consensual physicality limits the romantic relationships that they enjoy, but nevertheless, it does seems to be a predictor.)</li>

	<li>Curious about the world.</li>

	<li>An atheist, but also has what might be described as a “spiritual practice” (meditation, introspection, ritual, etc.).</li> 

	<li>Of Jewish ancestry.</li>
	
	<li>Doesn't drink (alcohol).</li>
		
	<li>[Both "having good style" and "visibly prioritizing comfort and practicatlity over appearance" have been predictors.]</li> 

	<li>Affable and sociable, though not necessarily extroverted per se. Generally happy.</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<p>To everyone who spends a little bit of time playing match maker, thank you. : )</p>
