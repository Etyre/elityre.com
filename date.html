	<!--I think that I need to rewrite this to be more...gentle?-->

	<p>I'm a straight (if asexual-leaning) man, single and seeking. I was born in 1994.</p>
	
	<h2>What I Want</h2>

	<p>Ultimately, I’m looking for a sort of <i>spiritual collaboration</i>. Partership with a person who is relentlessly dedicated to making
	the world bright, who is striving to face up to her own demons, to better live in integrity and more efffectively be a force for light 
	in the world, and who will help me in doing the same. I want a partner who inspires me to be better than I am.</p> <!--too many "ands"-->

	<p>But that is a long-term goal. For the time being, I’m just looking more female companionship in my life; I would like to spend more time with women I like. 
		
	<p>More specifcially, it would be great to have someone to spend time with on the order of once a week, cuddling and talking, being curious together, and maybe co-working or strength training, with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other.</p>

	<p>And, especially while I'm traveling, I'm pretty glad to go on causual dates with anyone who thinks "teaching each other about things tha one of us doesn't know about" or "trying together to puzzle out something that neither of us understands", is a good first date, even if it doesn't seem likely to lead to any kind of relationship.</p>

	
	<h2>Constraints and deal-breakers</h2>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>I am highly committed to my work. I think that the world is currently in a precarious state, moving in the direction of disaster, and that I personally stand any chance at all of doing something about that.</p> 

<p>As such, I work hard, and I spend the majority of my waking hours sequestered in my office.</p> 

<p>Anyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with that, either because they have a similar orientation to the world themselves, or because they’re chill with a relationship that is intimate, without being time intensive.</p> 

	<h3>Honesty</h3>
	<p>[coming back to this one]</p>
	
	<!---
	
	

I’m not willing to pretend something about you.

That’s a deal breaker for me

A commitment to honesty, to me is not a nice sounding hand-wavey thing. It is concrete and practical, 

This isn’t mostly about nice aspirations. It’s mostly about skill. Being honest is really hard. I have tried

If something is bothering one of us, we can bring it up, and figure out how to solve it together. If there’s a conflict between what we want, then we work to learn the true names of what each of us is valuing and wanting, and try to find a set up that statisfies both.


I take rationality very seriously.-->

<h3>Poly</h3>

<p>I care about feeling secure in my relationship with you, and knowing that you value me in a stable more-or-less non-fungible way. Aside from that, I am glad for my partner to have other partners, short term or long term, if that lights you up.</p>  

<p>Personally, I’m pretty monogamous by nature, in that I don’t want more than one partner. My sense of how to relate to romance has shifted over the past few years, though, so maybe this will shift too.</p> 

<h3>Kids</h3>

<p>I’m undecided about having kids. I’m not currently planning around having a family, but I would if I found a highly compatible partner, and it was important to her. (That is conditional on having enough money, and being part of a healthy enough community, that we could raise and educate them well, but I’m optimistic on both fronts.)</p> 
	
	<p>That is to say, I am <em>open</em> to having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.

<p>I do have strong feelings about genomic selection: if I have kids at all, I am adamant about using whatever technologies are available at the time to increase their life-long health and intelligence.</p> 

	
	
	<h2>Interested?</h2>

	<p>I'm greatful to everyone who takes inciatve and responds to this, even if it turns out we're not a good match. TDT-wise, your doing that is the only reason this systems works at all. So thank you. : ) </p> 

	<p>If you would like more detail about who I am, or what I care about, <a href="https://www.okcupid.com/profile/6765423466650624251">this</a> is an old okcupid profile of mine. However, I think you might get a less biased and more up-to-date picture of me by reading my <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/user/EpistemicHope">twitter threads</a> or my blogs.</p>

	<p><b>Some friends' descriptions of me:</b>


<p>Friend 1: <em>"Erudite, stoic, and unrelentingly devoted to good. Also a little bit clumsy, but you can leave that part out.”</em></p>

<p>Friend 2: <em> "Human, on the lower end of height but upper percentage of brain capacity with a weird interest in saying true things, keeping commitments, and deliberately practicing skills he wants to get good at."</em></p>

<p>Friend 3: <em>“Eli is kind of what you would imagine a human might be like if you hadn't met any humans but had built a lot of houses.”</em></p>
