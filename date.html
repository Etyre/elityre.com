	<h2>What I Want</h2>
	
	<p>I’m attempting to live with an <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1364023511983923202.html">open heart</a>, robust ethics, and scrupulous epistemic standards. Above everything else, I want relationships, romantic or otherwise, that support and nourish me in that.
	
	<p>I'm open to two pretty different flavors of relationship:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>a low-time-commitment, high-intimacy, companionship, on the one hand,</li>
		<li>and a high intensity, high commitment, long-term Partnership, on the other. </li>
		</ul>	

		<h3>Medium term - Once-or-twice-a-week companionship</h3> <!--High intimacy, low commitment companionship-->

		<p>Currently, I’m mainly looking for more companionship in my life.</p>
			
		<p>I would like to have to have someone to spend time with about once or twice a week: talking, circling, co-working or strength training, cuddling, having sex, being curious together, all with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other.</p> 
	
		<p>This kind of relationship amounts to approximately what poly people call a "secondary partnership": emotionally intimate, but not the primary structure of one's life. This might work best for someone who already has a primary partner, or who is otherwise committing most of their energies to a high intensity project.</p>
			
		<p>(<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyXcXT8yKdkxSxdkc1G4709NFBtfC6WVZym5rdbcS_s/edit?usp=sharing">This somewhat-out-of-date document</a> gives some ideas for what that could look like, given my focus on my work.)</p>
	
	</div>

	<h3>Long term - High intensity Partnership (with a capital P)</h3> <!--Intense partnership-->

	<p>In the long run, I’m looking for a <i>spiritual collaborator</i>*, for the other half of an <i>altruistic power couple</i>.</p>

	<!-- <p>I want a relationship that is about helping each other become stronger and making the world better. We work together, train together, rest together, and make it easier for each other to live in integrity with our values, and generally face the world together. We help each other be badasses. This entails, among other things, spending a lot of time working, at the expense of typical leisure activities. 
	(Some more operationalization <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZikhCHkCsii2ecOAlZG4UO4o2xXVLz7DYIjebmE0K0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.) -->
	
	<p>A Partnership with someone relentlessly and ambitiously dedicated to improving the world, who is striving to grow in skill and wisdom, who would accept my support in that, and who will support me in turn. A relationship in which we work together, train together, rest together, and help each other to live in integrity with our values. This entails, among other things, spending a lot of time working, at the expense of typical <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LRc22DoIj1NXCDyK02x4Aaa5-Ddg0Bk6_xwuAfz9X6c/edit?pli=1">fun</a>/leisure activities.</p>
	
	<p>I want a partner who inspires me to be better than I am.</p>

	<p>(Some more operationalization of what this kind of relationship might look like <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZikhCHkCsii2ecOAlZG4UO4o2xXVLz7DYIjebmE0K0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.)</p>

	<p>This is a very rare and intense kind of partnership, in some ways more committed than a marriage to raise a family.
		Finding a person who wants this, and making it work with them, is a serious, long-term, project.</p>
	
	<div>
	<p class="footnote">* - To be clear, I am an atheist. It is an extremely important fact about the universe (and about my worldview) that we are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sYgv4eYH82JEsTD34/beyond-the-reach-of-god">beyond the reach of God</a>. But I am deeply concerned with matters of the spirit, no matter that souls turn out to be implemented by neurons.</p>
	</div>
		
	
	<!--<p>In practice, this mostly entails hanging out a few times a week in the afternoon / early evening (in between my main work periods) to go on a walk or a hike, or coworking on tasks together in the evening to midnight. </p>-->

	<!-- <p>And, especially while I'm traveling, I'm glad to go on casual dates with anyone who thinks "sharing something one of us learned recently" or "trying to puzzle something out together" is a good first date, even if it doesn't seem likely to lead to any kind of long term relationship.</p> -->
	
	<!-- <p><b>Update as of February, 2024:</b> I'm still open to both of these kinds of relationships. However, I'm currently more inclined to focus on building my own life without weaving it deeply with another person, and am most interested in the lower intensity companionship, for the time being. You should still contact me if you're interested in either. </p> -->

	<!--<h4>What Dating Me Is Like</h4>-->
	
	<!-- <h4>Dates</h4>
	
	<p>Here are some activities that are my idea of a "good date". You don't have to be into all of these, just one of them.<p>
	
    <ul>
	<li>The uncomplicated default: We go on a walk (maybe into the hills, if we're in Berkeley) and talk, about life, about the world, about what we've each been pondering lately, about who and where we are and how we got there.</li>
	    <li>We meet up and <a href="https://circlinginstitute.com/what-is-circling-method/">Circle</a> together. If you're new to Circling, but interested, then we could do a similar, but more structured, Authentic Relating exercise, instead.</li>
    <!--<li> We try to make progress on some problem of yours. I listen, and try to help you solve it. Or, if there's something that you're trying to do or learn, and I try to help you get unstuck.</li> -->
    <!-- <li>We spend a half day trying to get a grip on something neither of us know anything about. (ie How do mitochondria work? How do you build a computer from logic gates? What's the deal with Modern Monetary Theory? How does the math of predictive processing work?) <!--A more extensive list of open questions is here--></li>
    <!-- <li>We go to some public place, like an airport, or a mall, or a zoo, and people-watch, comparing notes about what we observe and infer. Then we go and check our guesses"check our guesses" should be a link to some page that I've written about the importance of feedback, by talking with those people. --> 
	    <!--<li>We play around with some kind of new-to-us skill or modality (eg things like fermi estimates, or IFS, or vibe-reading, if any of those were new to me), and tinker to try and find functional-for-each-of-us versions.</li>-->
	    
	    <!--<li>We make the world better somehow. When I was yonger, I had a policy of always going volunteering for first dates. But -->
	    
	  <!-- </ul> -->
	    
	    <!-- <p>If there's some other activity which seems good to do together, suggest it! I'm generally up for trying things other than psychoactive substances.</p> --> 
	
	<h2>Constraints and relationship-essentials</h2>

	<h3>Work</h3>

	<!-- <p>I am highly committed to my work. 

	<p>According to my map which is not the territory, I'm likely a member of the last human generation. I think there's a sizable chance that I will die, and the human story will end, between now and 2040, because of AI stuff. 
		If there's not much time left, I want to live a beautiful life. That means, first and foremost, trying everything I can think of that might help save the future, and searching for more ideas to try.</p>  -->

	<!-- I think that the world is currently in a precarious state, <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/2023/02/17/my-current-summary-of-the-state-of-ai-risk/">moving in the direction of disaster</a>, and that I personally stand any chance at all of doing something about that.</p>  -->

	<!-- <p>As such, I work hard, and I spend the majority of my waking hours sequestered in my office.</p>  -->

	<p>Out of a combination of personal inclination and moral commitment, I work a lot<!--—on the order of 60 hours a week, depending on how you count-->. I spend the majority of my waking hours (including most evenings from 7pm to midnight) working, training, studying. In between work blocks, I exercise, eat my one meal a day, and nap. </p> 

	<!--I'm pretty "intense." I rarely socialize outside of work. For fun, I teach personal development workshops, meet with tutors to rapidly learn from their domain of exprteies, read (mostly textbooks, history books, and philosophical essays) always taking notes, write blog posts, and meditate.-->

	<p>Anyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with that, either because they have a similar orientation to the world themselves, or because they’re chill with a relationship that is intimate, without being time-intensive.</p> 

	<!-- <p class="footnote">* - It also includes striving for a very high standard of integrity, being fastidiously honest, staying fit and healthy, keeping a vegan diet, eating wholesome food with my full attention, being present, living with an open heart, and generally, striving to be the kind of creature robustly makes things better instead of worse.</p> -->
	
</div>

	<h3>Honesty</h3>

	<p>The thing that is most important to me in all of my personal relationships is skilled honesty. </p>

	<p>I've sometimes been in a context where there was a <a href="https://mindingourway.com/steering-towards-forbidden-conversations/">forbiden conversation</a>, some true fact, or some belief I held, that I didn't feel free to acknowledge–because it would offend someone, or because it “wasn’t my place”, or because pointing out some farce would make things worse, or because it seemed like it was intruding on the other person, who didn't want to hear it, etc. In a situation like this, I feel presure to pretend about, or distract from, or downplay the thing.</p>

	<p>I’ve come to think that I can’t build a robust relationship on a foundation of this kind of holding back. I want to participate in contexts where I can be fully honest, and it is safe and practical for people to be fully honest with me, up to and including all of things that it is usually not polite or acceptable to say.</p>

	<p>Creating those kinds of contexts by merely <i>intending to be honest</i> isn't sustainable. It requires skill to say the things that can't usually be said, in a way that doesn't do undue harm.</p>	

	<p>I make explicit considered effort in all my important relationships, to build an API such that the two of us can say anything (including our judgements, frustrations, and deep feedback) in a way that the other party can hear it without feeling attacked. And I’ve sought to develop the skills to support this kind of honesty, <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-Relationships/dp/189200528X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=nonviolent+communication&qid=1627363910&sr=8-1">Nonviolent Communication</a>, <a href="https://musingsandroughdrafts.com/2019/09/27/basic-double-crux-pattern-example/">rationality</a>, and <a href="https://circlinginstitute.com/what-is-circling-method/">circling</a> skill.</p>

	<p>But even so, I am not a master at this. I still sometimes find myself in situations where there's something that feels to awkward to share even in otherwise candid relationships. I need help to maintain this kind of connection.</p>

	<p>It is important to me that, between the two of us, we have enough skill to maintain this kind of connection: that it continues to feel possible, for you and for me, to share what’s up for us, even if that is uncomfortable or impolite or awkward. This is crucial for me in an intimate relationship.</p>
	

	<!--<p>Maybe you do this in some very different way than I do, but familiarity with Circling and NVC, a developed introspective access, skills related to making space for / owning your triggers, and a basic "desire to relate to what's true", are all good signs.</p>-->

	<h3>Meta</h3>

	<p>Relatedly, relationships with me typically involve a lot of “meta”: doing checkins, talking about the relationship and how it is or isn't working, flagging frictions and generating creative solutions together, investing effort trying to improve our communication processes, etc.</p>

	<p>Some past partners have found this onerous or annoying. “Can’t we skip all the process talk, and just do the cool things that the relationship is about?” I don’t see it that way. Much of what I care about in a relationship is the strength of the relationship itself, and this sort of meta and process-iteration is a means to that.</p>
	
	<p>Completely unironically, leaving comments on my relationship-communication google docs is one of my love languages. (The google doc format is optional. That's just a communication method that has worked well for some past partners.)</p>

	<h3>Relationship style</h3>

	<p>I'm dispositionally monogamous, generally preferring to commit to only one person. However, I am happy to date people who have other partners themselves, especially if I can see that that makes them happy.</p>
		
	<p>I have only ever seriously dated one person at a time, and incidentally, I have only ever seriously dated people who were poly. (Effectively, I was monogamously partnered with someone who was dating other people.)</p>
		
	<p>I am more than willing to participate in a fully-monogamous partnership, if we're a good fit. I've dated poly people, not because I particularly prefer poly, but because the people I've been interested in have been poly.</p>

	<h3>Kids</h3>

	<p>Raising kids appeals to me, but I’m not currently planning around having a family in the pre-singularity. However, I would do that if I found a <i>highly</i> compatible partner and having kids was important to her.</p> 

	<p>That is to say, I am <em>open</em> to having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.</p>

	<!-- <p>However, due to my commitment to my work (which I don't expect to change this decade), we would need to have a frank negotiation about the division of labor in child-rearing, and if the level of support (financial, emotional, labor, etc) I'm able and willing to offer, will be sufficient to making having kids a good idea.  </p> -->

	<p>I do have strong views about schooling and education.</p>

	<p>I think that I am unusually committed to the good, which is probably somewhat heritable, and the world would be better if there were more people in it like me. If you wanted my sperm, without parental obligations, I am <em>likely</em> open to that, though I can probably suggest even better candidates.</p>

	<p>(I think I will probably actively seek out a partner for raising a family after humanity is out of the <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/acute-risk-period">acute risk period</a> and life extension is solved.)</p>

	<!--<p>I do have strong feelings about genomic selection: if I have kids at all, I am adamant about using whatever technologies are available at the time to increase their life-long health and intelligence.</p>-->

		<!--<h3>Height</h3> 

		<p>I’m pretty short for an American man (around 5’4”), though I am fit and muscular.</p> 

	<p>Insofar as height is something that my partner might care about, I’m sorry that I can't offer this. I would change it if I could, but tbe relevant biotechnology is not yet advanced enough (and probably won't be in the next 20 years).</p>-->

	<h3>Sex</h3>
	
	<!-- <p>Sex is not a priority for me. I would like to have sex with an intimate partner, but if she doesn't want that or can't, that's not a deal-breaker for me.</p>  -->

	<p>Sex is more important to me in the case of a once-or-twice-a-week companion than in the case of a committed Partnership. The point of having a capital-P partnership is mostly to help each other be better. For that, and sex can be nice, but it isn't necessary. In the case of a more casual relationship, sexual and intimate emotional satisfaction is a larger fraction of what I care about.</p>

	<p>I’m interested in doing deliberate practice to get good at sex: focusing on my partner’s experience, with ample verbal and nonverbal feedback (plus after-action debriefs). It would obviously be better to do this with an emotionally-intimate partner, but I'm potentially open to trying with someone who I'm not otherwise dating, if we can establish really good communication and clarity about expectations first.</p>
	
	<!-- <p>(I have inclinations toward sexual dominance, but not particularly towards sexual sadism. I’d be interested in exploring kink or D/s if and only if that sounded exciting to my partner.)</p>
	</p> -->

	<h3>Vegetarianism</h3>

	<p>I'm vegan (with <a href="http://elityre.com/vegan-policy.html">some caveats</a>). So far, 100% of the people that I've dated seriously and 100% of the people that I've ever been in love with have been vegan. This is mostly correlation—the sort of people that I tend to be attracted to tend to be vegans. But it's <em>also</em> causal—I care about the ethics of the people I spend time with. For most people, eating factory farmed meat is the action that has the most awful direct negative consequences, that they partake in regularly. (Additionally, seeing someone eat meat tends to reduce my level of attraction for them.)</p>

	<p>I'm not confident, but I think I probably don't want to date people who aren't vegetarian, or who aren't otherwise careful about the externalities their life has on animals in factory farms.</p>

	<p>I'm not listing this as a firm deal-breaker, but it is important to me. If you eat factory farmed meat, and we get moderately far into dating, I'll want to have an honest and reasoned conversation with you about the ethics and tradeoffs involved.</p>

	<p>(I'm conscious that abstaining from animal products entirely is not a healthy choice for some people, and that there are additional tradeoffs.)</p>
	
	<h2>Some notes about the kind of person I'm looking for</h2>

	<p>I tend to like, and like spending time with, people who embody either unusual moral commitment, emotional/relational skill, and/or intelligence.</p>

	<p>Some concrete, non-exhaustive, positive signs (both causal and statistical) that you might be the kind of person that I like...</p> 

	<p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;" font-size="1em" padding="3em">You're vegan · You've done more than 20 hours of circling · You donate a largish-fraction 
		of your income, or did at some point in your life · You majored in (or audiodiacted) a STEM subject · You participate in volunteer or social activism projects · You don't drink alcohol · You have a personal practice of Gendlin Focusing or parts-work · You've reflected seriously on ethics and integrity, and have some provisional conclusions which guide your personal choices · You prioritize exercise and physical health · You write a blog about ideas · You read (most of) the LessWrong Sequences · You invest heavily in personal development · You like or have been involved with musical theater · You distinguish between the social justice issues that are rolling moral catastrophes and the ones that aren't · You have at least one private or public writeup of how you think about ethics or a particular ethical decision · You journal regularly · You consider "having true beliefs" to be an ethical imperative </p>

	<h2>Some friends' descriptions of me:</h2>


<p>Friend 1: <em>"Erudite, stoic, and unrelentingly devoted to good. Also a little bit clumsy, but you can leave that part out.”</em></p>

<p>Friend 2: <em> "Human, on the lower end of height but upper percentage of brain capacity with a weird interest in saying true things, keeping commitments, and deliberately practicing skills he wants to get good at."</em></p>

<p>Friend 3: <em>“Eli is kind of what you would imagine a human might be like if you hadn't met any humans but had built a lot of houses.”</em></p>

	<h2>Aid my quest!</h2>

<p>If you’re not a good match with me (you’re male, or married, or want something different than I do), but you'd like this project to succeed, 
	you can help by connecting me with thoughtful, single (or non-polysaturated) women who want the sort of thing that I want.<!-- / you think might want to date me--> If you took even 5 minutes right now to flip through your facebook friends and consider if any of them might want to date someone like me, you will earn my <a href="bounties.html">gratitude</a><!--, and, hopefuly, that of the other party as well-->. 

<!--<p>Secondly, you can give me feedback on this page. I've benefited enormously from hearing people's unfiltered reactions to the text here, so that I can iterate to a version that communicates what is important, without cruft. If you're interested in giving me line by line comments of how this lands for you, especially if you're a woman who shares many of my values, I would greatly appreciate it. However, please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me 
to tell me that you're interested, instead of just sending me your reactions, since it is less helpful to get feedback while I'm in the revision stage and still incorporating the feedback from the last round.</p>-->

	<h3>What sort of person am I looking for?</h3>
,
<p>This section is all the way down here, at the bottom of the page, because it’s mostly not relevant for people reading to see if they if they might want to go on a date with me. If they feel excited by the sort of interactions that I describe, I don’t want to discourage them because they don’t embody the traits I outline here.</p>

<p>However, for third parties who are hoping to help play match-maker, the above is a bit...abstract.</p>

<p>So the following are some more concrete traits, that empirically, in my life so far, have been predictive of people that I have liked and/or loved. These are not “standards”, in the sense of characteristics that I insist on in a partner, but rather characteristics or traits that are shared by many of the women I most like spending time with.</p>

<p>If you happen to know someone who is well described by the following, you might be doing us both a favor by, introing us, or sending her a link to this page.</p>

	<h4>Empirical predictors of the kinds of people Eli wants to date</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Female, in roughly my age range.</li>
	<li>Unusually ethical. Committed to making the world right, or fair, or good, or much better than it currently is.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The sort of person who, at some point in her life, thought that / planned to give away most of her income to charity.</li>

		<li>Probably vegan or vegetarian.</li>
			
		</ul>

	<li>Works a lot. Is the sort of person who might be described as a workaholic. </li>

	<li>Thoughtful, and puts her thought into practice. [Can I elaborate this? Exmaples would be helpful.</li>

	<li>Intelligent.</li> 
	<ul>
		<li>In particular, possessing impressive verbal fluency. She's self assured and fast on her feet in conversation. </li>
			
		</ul>
		
	<li>Might be described as conventionally "pretty". (I feel a bit embarrased about including this, because it seems like a sad fact about the world that people's non-consensual physicality limits the romantic relationships that they enjoy, but nevertheless, it does seems to be a predictor.)</li>

	<li>Curious about the world.</li>

	<li>An atheist, but also has what might be described as a “spiritual practice” (meditation, introspection, ritual, gratitude practice, a reverence for the sacred, a focus on intentionality, etc.).</li> 

	<li>Of Jewish ancestry.</li>
	
	<li>Doesn't drink (alcohol).</li>
		
	<li>[Both "having good style" and "visibly prioritizing comfort and practicatlity over appearance" have been predictors.]</li> 

	<li>Affable and sociable, though not necessarily extroverted per se. Generally happy.</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<p>To everyone who spends a little bit of time playing match maker, thank you. : )</p>
