	<!--I think that I need to rewrite this to be more...gentle?-->

	<p>I'm a straight (if asexual-leaning) man, single and seeking. I was born in 1994.</p>

	<p>(I look like <a href="personal-photos.html">this</a>.)</p>
	
	<h2>What I Want</h2>
	<h3>Long term</h3>

	<p>Ultimately, I’m looking for a sort of <i>spiritual collaboration</i>. A Partnership with someone relentlessly and ambitiously dedicated to improving the world, who is striving <!--to face up to her own demons, -->to grow in skill and wisdom, in order <!--better live in integrity and--> more effectively be a force for light 
	in the universe, who will support me in doing the same. We work to make each other stronger. And we face the world together.*</p>
	
	<p>I want a partner who inspires me to be better than I am.</p>
	
	<!--<p>I have wanted something like this since I first booted up into a self-reflective, self-modifying loop at around 15.
	I think, that this is what I will ultimately want. However, currently I'm focusing on setting up my life and work to be stable without the support of
	a deep partnership. This is not the <em>main</em> thing I'm looking for at the moment, though I would be remiss not to at least mention this, in case a compatible person comes along.</p> -->

	<p>* - Some more operationalization <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZikhCHkCsii2ecOAlZG4UO4o2xXVLz7DYIjebmE0K0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Medium term</h3>

	<p><!--But that is a long term aim.-->But, for the time being, I’m looking more female companionship in my life.<!--: I would like to spend more time with women I like.--> 
		
	<p>It would be great to have someone to hang out with on the order of once a week: talking, being curious together, circling a lot, co-working or strength training, maybe cuddling, with a practiced expectation of being fully honest with each other.</p>

	<!--<p>In practice, this mostly entails hanging out a few times a week in the afternoon / early evening (in between my main work periods) to go on a walk or a hike, or coworking on tasks together in the evening to midnight. </p>-->

	<p>And, especially while I'm traveling, I'm glad to go on casual dates with anyone who thinks "sharing something one of us learned recently" or "trying to puzzle something out together" is a good first date, even if it doesn't seem likely to lead to any kind of long term relationship.</p>
	
	<!--<h4>What Dating Me Is Like</h4>-->
	
	<h4>Dates</h4>
	
	<p>Here are some activities that are my idea of a "good date". You don't have to be into all of these, just one of them.<p>
	
    <ul>
	    <li>The default: We go on a walk (maybe into the hills, if we're in Berkeley) and talk, about life, about the world, about what matters, about how we got where we are.</li>
    <li> We talk about some problem that you have, I listen, and try to help you solve it. Or there's something that you're trying to do or learn, and I try to help you get unstuck.</li> 
    <li>We spend a half day trying to get a grips on something neither of us know anything about: ie How do mitocondria work? How do you build a computer from logic gates? What's the deal with Modern Monetary Theory? How does the math of predictive processing work?</li>
    <li>We play around with some kind of new-to-us skill or modality (eg things like fermi estimates, or IFS, or vibe-reading, if any of those were new to me), and tinker to try and find functional-for-each-of-us versions.</li>
	    
	  </ul>
	    
	    <p>Also, if you have an idea, I'm generally up for trying something that I've not done before.</p>
	
	<h2>Constraints and deal-breakers</h2>

	<h3>Work</h3>

	<p>I am highly committed to my work. I think that the world is currently in a precarious state, moving in the direction of disaster, and that I personally stand any chance at all of doing something about that.</p> 

	<p>As such, I work hard, and I spend the majority of my waking hours sequestered in my office.</p> 

	<p>Anyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with that, either because they have a similar orientation to the world themselves, or because they’re chill with a relationship that is intimate, without being time-intensive.</p> 

	<h3>Honesty</h3>
	<p>The thing that is most important to me in all of my personal relationships is skilled honesty. </p>

	<p>I’ve sometimes been in contexts where there was something important that I felt like I “wasn’t allowed to say” for some reason or another. (Because it would offend someone, or because it “wasn’t my place”, or because pointing out some farce would make things worse, or something else.)</p>

	<p>I’ve come to think that you can’t build anything robust on a foundation of this kind of holding back. I want to participate in contexts where I can be fully honest, and it is safe and practical for people to be fully honest with me, upto and including all of things that it is usually not polite or acceptable to say.</p>

	<p>Creating those kinds of contexts by main force isn't sustainable. It requires skill to say the things that can't usually be said, in a way that doesn't break everything.</p>	

	<p>I make explicit, considered, effort, in all my important relationships, to build an API such that the two of us can say anything (including our judgements, frustrations, and deep feedback), in a way that the other party can hear it, without feeling attacked. And I’ve sought to develop the skills to support this kind of honesty, circling skill, NVC, and rationality.</p>

	<p>It is important to me that, between the two of us, we have enough skill to maintain this kind of connection: That it continues to feel possible, for you and for me, to share what’s up for us, even if that is uncomfortable or impolite or awkward.</p>
	</p>

	<!--<p>Maybe you do this in some very different way than I do, but familiarity with Circling and NVC, a developed introspective access, skills related to making space for / owning your triggers, and a basic "desire to relate to what's true", are all good signs.</p>-->


	<h3>Relationship style</h3>

	<p>I care about feeling secure in my relationship with my partner, and knowing that she values me in a stable more-or-less non-fungible way. Aside from that, I am glad for my partner to have other partners, short term or long term, if that lights her up.</p>  

	<p>Personally, I’m pretty monogamous by nature, in that I don’t have much desire for more than one partner. (That said, my sense of how I relate to romance has shifted over the past few years, so maybe this will shift too.)</p> 

	<h3>Kids</h3>

	<p>I’m undecided about having kids. I’m not currently planning around having a family, but I would if I found a <i>highly</i> compatible partner, and it was important to her.**</p> 

		<p>That is to say, I am <em>open</em> to having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.</p>

	<p>I do have strong feelings about genomic selection: if I have kids at all, I am adamant about using whatever technologies are available at the time to increase their life-long health and intelligence.</p>

	<p>** - This is conditional on having enough money, and being part of a healthy enough community that we could raise and educate kids well, but I think I'm on a good trajectory on both those fronts, and don't expect either money or community to be the limiting considerations.</p>


		<!--<h3>Height</h3> 

		<p>I’m pretty short for an American man (around 5’4”), though I am fit and muscular.</p> 

	<p>Insofar as height is something that my partner might care about, I’m sorry that I can't offer this. I would change it if I could, but tbe relevant biotechnology is not yet advanced enough (and probably won't be in the next 20 years).</p>-->

	<h2>Some friends' descriptions of me:</h2>


<p>Friend 1: <em>"Erudite, stoic, and unrelentingly devoted to good. Also a little bit clumsy, but you can leave that part out.”</em></p>

<p>Friend 2: <em> "Human, on the lower end of height but upper percentage of brain capacity with a weird interest in saying true things, keeping commitments, and deliberately practicing skills he wants to get good at."</em></p>

<p>Friend 3: <em>“Eli is kind of what you would imagine a human might be like if you hadn't met any humans but had built a lot of houses.”</em></p>
		

	
	<h2>Interested?</h2>
	
	<p>If any of the above seems good to you, and you want to explore further, feel free to <a href="contact.html">send me a message</a> saying so. Or, if you don't know where to start, you can fill out

	<p>I'm grateful to everyone who takes initiative and reaches out, even if it turns out we're not a good match. TDT-wise, your doing that is the only reason this system works at all. So thank you. : ) </p>
