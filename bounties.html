		<h1>Open Bounties</h1>
	</div>
	
	
<div class="main text">
	
  <p>If you know about something, or can teach me something, that straight up solves one of my open problems, I'm psyched to compenssate you for it. </p>
    
    <p>The following are some currently outstanding bounties, related to areas that I would like to solve or substantially improve.</p>
  
    <p>[Please note that I am the final arbiter of whether a solution satisifes any given bounty. I'm offering this in good faith, but there's a definite possiblility that
      you'll offer some solution that I deem to "not count" for some reason that I hadn't previously specified.] </p>
  
	<h3><b>$2000</b> - An introduction to someone that I end up dating for more than a year.</h3>
	
    <h3><b>$1000</b> - Any intervention that can <i>significantly</i> imporve my personal learning rate, especially at understanding and assimilating technical / mathmatical concepts. </h3>
    
	<p>To be eligable for the bounty, the effect should either be objectively verifiable (eg "there's a clear change in the slope of the progress-graph at the point of the intervention"; I'm glad to operationalize some specific efficacy measure
	as appropriate), or if subjective, strong enough that I am personally impressed that it is significant. 
	(I'll give partial bounties for less impressive interventions.)</p>
	
	<h3> $1000 - Safely cure my allergies.</h3>
<p>I have both seasonal sinus allergies and food allergies, and they suck. 
	I’ll gladly pay $1000 to anyone who can point me towards an intervention that can manage any of the following</p>
<ul>
	<le>Permanently cure my seasonal allergies</le>
	<le>Permanently cure my allergy to animal dander</le>
<le>Permanently cure my food allergy to nuts</le>
<le>Permanently cure my food allergy to mustard </le>
<le>Permanently cure my food allergy to milk</le>
<p> Obviously, this needs to be done in a way that is safe and healthy. I’m not interested in an almost-cure that causes me to go into anaphylactic shock down the line.</p>
	
	<h3>$500 - Increase my typing speed by at least 10 wpm</hs>
Over the course of 2020, I brought my average typing speed (as measured by typeracer [link]) up from about 59 words per minute, to an average speed of about 73 wpm. I’m interested in any intervention that would systematically increase my typing speed into the range of 80 to 90 wpm, with 15 hours of practice or fewer.
$500 - Some method for reliably falling asleep when I lay down to nap
<!--This is my current method for falling asleep, which is effective for napping about x% of the time.-->
Mental procedures are prefered, but safe chemical or mechanical interventions, or something I’m not even thinking of, are admissible.
$ 50 to 500 (depending on how effective it is) - Some way to systematically “amp myself up” to push myself when exercising.
$500 - Any intervention that would allow me to read precisely and correctly
I have some kind of cognitive bug such that I have substantial difficulty reading individual characters correctly. Unless I am going very slowly and carefully, paying attention with high intensity, and sometimes even then, I’m apt to read words and especially numbers incorrectly. 
For instance, I’ll read the number “53” as “38”, or “24” as “28” and not notice that I made an error.
I’m interested in any intervention that can diagnose, repair, or compensate for, this deficiency.
$300 - Help me learn the multiplication and division math fact families for 7, 8, and 12.
Possibly related to the above, learning math facts was pretty challenging for me, as a kid. As an adult, I’ve mostly gone back and repaired that gap, so that I now mostly know my multiplication and division tables.
But the multiplication/ division math fact families involving 7, 8, and 12, just don’t seem to stick, for me. I’m interested in any method or training regime that would get them to stick for me, with a moderate amount of work. 
$100 - Any intervention to safely and healthily increase my bodyweight.
I weigh about 125 pounds, and would prefer to weigh around 150 pounds so long as I can do that healthily. 

	
	<!---<p><b>$1000</b> - Any practical method of increasing an adults overal height by at least 2 inches, less expensive than full limb <a href="blank">lengthening surgery</a>, which is usually priced around $85,000 for a procedure in the US. External boosts like elevator shoes don't count.</p>-->
      
    	<!--<p><em>$500<em> - Any intervention by which I can lower my physiological arousal, as measured by GSR, from X to Y, in under Z minutes.</p>-->
    	    
	<p><b>$200</b> - A pointer to a safe, side-effect free steroid for increasing muscular strength.</p>
	    	    
    <p><b>$200</b> - A pointer to a safe therapy that can increase the hand size and/or the finger lengths of an fully grown adult.</p>
