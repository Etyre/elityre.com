  <p>If you know about something, or can teach me something, that straight up solves one of my open problems, I'm psyched to compenssate you for it. </p>
    
    <p>The following are some currently outstanding bounties, related to areas that I would like to solve or substantially improve.</p>
  
    <p>[Please note that I am the final arbiter of whether a solution satisifes any given bounty. I'm offering this in good faith, but there's a definite possiblility that
      you'll offer some solution that I deem to "not count" for some reason that I hadn't previously specified.] </p>
  
    <p><b>$2000</b> - An introduction to someone that I end up dating for more than a year.
	
    <p><b>$1000</b> - Any intervention that can <i>significantly</i> imporve my personal learning rate, especially at understanding and assimilating technical / mathmatical concepts. </p>
    
	<p>To be eligable for the bounty, the effect should either be objectively verifiable (eg "there's a clear change in the slope of the progress-graph at the point of the intervention"; I'm glad to operationalize some specific efficacy measure
	as appropriate), or if subjective, strong enough that I am personally impressed that it is significant. 
	(I'll give partial bounties for less impressive interventions.)</p>
	
	
	<!---<p><b>$1000</b> - Any practical method of increasing an adults overal height by at least 2 inches, less expensive than full limb <a href="blank">lengthening surgery</a>, which is usually priced around $85,000 for a procedure in the US. External boosts like elevator shoes don't count.</p>-->
      
    	<!--<p><em>$500<em> - Any intervention by which I can lower my physiological arousal, as measured by GSR, from X to Y, in under Z minutes.</p>-->
    	    
	<p><b>$200</b> - A pointer to a safe, side-effect free steroid for increasing muscular strength.</p>
	    	    
    <p><b>$200</b> - A pointer to a safe therapy that can increase the hand size and/or the finger lengths of an fully grown adult.</p>
