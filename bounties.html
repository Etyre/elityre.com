		<h1>Open Bounties</h1>
	</div>
	
	
<div class="main text">
	
  <p>If you know about something, or can teach me something, that straight up solves one of my open problems, I'm psyched to compensate you for it. </p>
    
    <p>The following are some currently outstanding bounties, related to areas that I would like to solve or substantially improve.</p>
  
    <p><b>Note 1:</b> Bounties are awarded for interventions that successfully solve my problem. It is a possibility that you'll suggest some intervention that matches what I describe, but for some reason or another, isn't actually feasible as a solution. I may pay partial bounties for partial solutions, at my own discretion. </p>
  
	<p><b>Note 2:</b> To be eligible for the full bounty, an intervention should be complete in of itself, not requiring me to do additional research work or iteration, myself. However, I'll gladly give partial bounties for suggestions, that I follow up on, and ultimately work. For example, if a person reaches out about a method to increase my typing speed, and we set up a session so that they can coach me through it, and it works, they've earned the full bounty. If someone contacts me and says "have you tried [x] methodology, for improving your typing? I've heard it's effective for things like that", I hadn't heard of [x] methodology, and I google around to find some way to learn [x] methodology, and this eventually leads me to a solution to my problem, I'll pay out a partial bounty (of around 10%), at my discretion.</p>
	
	<h2>Currently Posted Bounties</h2>
	
	<h3><b>$2000</b> - An introduction to someone that I end up dating for more than a year.</h3>
	
	<p>See my <a href="date.html">date me page</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Additionally, the following are some properties that, in my experience so far, are disproportionately common among women that I have liked and/or loved. Obviously, this list isn’t definitive and none of these are requirements. A person doesn’t need to embody all of these features, or even most of them, to be a good match for me. However, if you <i>do</i> happen to know someone who is close to being well-described by the following, you might be doing us both a favor by introducing us or forwarding her my date-me page.</p>

	<h4>Characteristics of Eli's ideal partner</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Female, in roughly my age range.</li>
	<li>Unusually ethical. Committed to making the world right, or fair, or good, or much better than it currently is.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The sort of person who, at some point in her life, thought that / planned to give away most of her income to charity.</li>

		<li>Probably vegan, or vegetarian.</li>
			
		</ul>

	<li>Works a lot. Is the sort of person who might be described as a workaholic. </li>

	<li> Thoughtful, and puts her thought into practice. <!--[Can I elaborate this? Exmaples would be helpful. --></li>

	<li>Intelligent, and in particular, possessing impressive verbal fluency. She's fast on her feet in conversation. </li>

	<li>Curious about the world</li>

	<li>An atheist, but also has what might be described as a “spiritual practice” (meditation, introspection, ritual, etc.).</li> 

	<li>Of Jewish ancestry.</li>	

	<li>Affable and sociable, though not necessarily extroverted per se.</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>If you put <i>yourself</i> forward as a person that I should date, and we do end up dating, then I'll donate this bounty to an efficient charity.</p>

	
    <h3><b>$1000</b> - Any intervention that <i>significantly</i> improves my personal learning rate, especially at understanding and assimilating technical / mathematical concepts. </h3>
    
	<p>To be eligible for the bounty, the effect should either be objectively verifiable (eg "there's a clear change in the slope of the progress-graph at the point of the intervention"; I'm glad to operationalize some specific efficacy measure
	as appropriate), or if subjective, be strong enough that I am personally impressed that it is significant. 
	(I'll give partial bounties for less impressive interventions.)</p>
	
	<h3>$1000 - Any intervention that improves my sleep quality</h3>
	
	<p>More specifically, any intervention that...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lowers my average resting heart rate</li>
			<li>Increases my sleep efficiency (ie the time that I'm actually asleep while in bed), or</li>
			<li>Shortens sleep latency</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>...as measured by my Oura ring, in a randomized (night by night) experiment, and is something that is feasible for me to do most nights.<p>
			

	<h3> $1000 - Safely cure my allergies.</h3>
	<p>I have both seasonal sinus allergies and food allergies, and they suck. I’ll gladly pay $1000 to anyone who can point me towards an intervention that can manage any of the following</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Permanently cure my seasonal allergies</li>
	<li>Permanently cure my allergy to animal dander</li>
	<li>Permanently cure my food allergy to nuts</li>
	<li>Permanently cure my food allergy to mustard </li>
	<li>Permanently cure my food allergy to milk</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<p> Obviously, this needs to be done in a way that is safe and healthy. I’m not interested in an almost-cure that causes me to go into anaphylactic shock down the line.</p>
	
	
<h3>$50 - A photo of me that displaces one of my top 4 photos, ranked by total score, on <a href="https://www.photofeeler.com">photofeeler.com</a>.</h3>

	<p>For context, <a href="top-four-photos.html">these</a> are my current 4 highest ranked photos. I think these shouldn't be that hard to beat.</p>

	
	
	
	<h3>$500 - Making nasal breathing sustainable for me</h3>
	
	<p>I often breath through my mouth. I've tried mouth taping, and I can't do it comfortably for more than a few minutes: my sinuses are apparently constricted and/or clogged enough, that my airflow is constricted. I'm interested in any intervention that would make it easy to breath habitually through my nose.</p>
	
	<h3>$500 - Increase my typing speed by at least 10 wpm</h3>
	
<p><a href="https://efficacyengineering.wordpress.com/category/project-learning-to-touch-type-fluidly/">Over the course of 2020</a>, I brought my average typing speed (as measured in <a href="https://play.typeracer.com/">typeracer</a>) up from about 59 words per minute to an average speed of about 75 wpm. I haven't put much effort into it since then, but I’m interested in any intervention that would systematically increase my typing speed into the range of 80 to 90 wpm, with 15 or fewer hours of practice.</p>

	<h3> $500 - Some method for reliably falling asleep when I lay down to nap</h3>
	
	<!--This is my current method for falling asleep, which is effective for napping about x% of the time.
	Mental procedures are prefered, but safe chemical or mechanical interventions, or something I’m not even thinking of, are admissible.-->
	
<!--<h3> $50 to 500 (depending on how effective it is) - Some way to systematically “amp myself up” to push myself when exercising.<h3>-->
	
	<h3> $500 - Any intervention that would allow me to read precisely and correctly</h3>
	
<p>I have some kind of cognitive bug such that I have substantial difficulty reading individual characters correctly. Unless I am going very slowly and carefully, paying attention with high intensity, and sometimes even then, I’m apt to read words and especially numbers incorrectly. 
For instance, I’ll read the number “53” as “38”, or “24” as “28” and not notice that I made an error.</p>

<p>I’m interested in any intervention that can diagnose, repair, or compensate for, this deficiency.</p>
	
<h3>$200 - Any intervention or pedagogical method that allows me to finally learn the multiplication and division math fact families for 7, 8, and 12.</h3>
	
<p>Possibly related to the above, learning math facts was pretty challenging for me, as a kid. As an adult, I’ve mostly gone back and repaired that gap, so that I now mostly know my multiplication and division tables.
But the multiplication/ division math fact families involving 7, 8, and 12, just don’t seem to stick, for me. I’m interested in any method or training regime that would get them to stick for me, with a moderate amount of effort (5 hours?) on my part.</p> 


	
	<h3> $200 - Any intervention to safely and healthily increase my bodyweight.</h3>
<p>I weigh about 123 pounds, and would prefer to weigh around 150 pounds, so long as I can do that healthily. <p>

	
	<!---<p><b>$1000</b> - Any practical method of increasing an adults overal height by at least 2 inches, less expensive than full limb <a href="blank">lengthening surgery</a>, which is usually priced around $85,000 for a procedure in the US. External boosts like elevator shoes don't count.</p>-->
      
    	<!--<p><em>$500<em> - Any intervention by which I can lower my physiological arousal, as measured by GSR, from X to Y, in under Z minutes.</p>-->
    	    
<h3><b>$200</b> - A pointer to a safe, side-effect free steroid for increasing muscular strength.</h3>
	
	<h3>$2000 - An intervention that would make my body bigger</h3>

<p>I stand 5 feet 3 inches tall. I weigh around 123 pounds. My shoe size is a US men’s 5. My proportions are aproximately those of a typical man, but scaled down a bit.</p>

<p>I don’t mind being short, but I really dislike being <i>small</i>. Aside from the practical drawbacks, I have mild body-dysphoria about it. My hands feel too small. The diameter of my head feels disturbingly small.</p>

<p>I am interested in any safe interventions to physically increase the size of my body, and my bones in particular.</p>
