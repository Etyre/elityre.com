    <h3>1. Prevent AI takeover</h3>


    <h2>Provisional policy recommendations</h2>



    - and how would I organize society

you want to find ways to have rents and have to reduce living expenses by a lot so people don't need to work as much unless they want to. You want to mostly do this on the supply side because otherwise extractive forces will grab the gains

you want to stop AI development, with the possible exception of AI specialized precisely specifically for biotech. You need security clearances to work with advanced AI systems.

Yeah deregulate. Everything. Stop AI progress, except for biotech. Carefully set up a bunch of protections. For against pandemics deregulate everything else.

Flush. You want supply side alleviation? Of

of living expenses.

Allow to create conditions for innovation in institution designs

Yeah, so here's I'm imagining myself in an interview. Look, here's the deal, if you want to. I'm if I'm like, I'm interested in trying to improve the well being of the people of this country in the world. And when I asked what things would most improve people's well being, and like the first thing is that they have go to work a bunch. They have to work a bunch in order to survive. And you might think that the solution to that is to just give people money, but the problem with just giving people money is that

the world around them evolves and adapts to take to extract more of that money from them. So I think you have to do this on the supply side. You need to decrease instead of giving people more money, you decrease the cost of living. I wanted to be the case that most people if they want to can easily support themselves on a part time job.

And lots of people decide to work more than that. And that's, that's great. I love that I want to support that. And lots of people decide that they don't they don't want to work and they want to invest in other things. Invest in their community. Make cool art. That sounds great too. And there will be lots of people said that they

they don't that they don't want to do much they want to watch TV and play video games. And that's not what I would choose to do. But you know what, that's their, their lives. If that's if that's them living their best lives and great that's the first thing. One decrease the cost of living

second thing. The second thing that impacts that makes a big difference for people's well being is just their physical health. Now granted, most people don't invest very much in their physical health. You can tell by how many people are overweight but I how much people exercise. But I basically I basically want it to be the case that we have the technologies for more people to live healthily for longer. I personally want that for myself. I want it for my family. And it's something that I wish was available, both for everyone in the world

want to give people more freedom to live the kinds of lives that they think are good

for longer?

Wonder if instead of targeting the presidency we should target the governor's office seems really hard to become President of the United States. Seems like maybe it's a lot easier to run a campaign.

To become the governor of some some state, New Hampshire, maybe Texas and then implement a bunch of reforms, especially if you're willing to challenge the federal government. You're like me gonna back you have you break these regulations on our territory well back you

man, you just straight up go to war with a lot of the deep state. A lot of the bureaucracy. You're like crypto is illegal. Crypto is legal. Here in Texas, Idaho, California, whatever.

me it doesn't actually help the ban. Yeah, development just in Texas. As part of the thing
