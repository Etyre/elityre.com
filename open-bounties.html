  <p>If you know about something, or can teach me something, that straight up solves one of my open problems, I'm psyched to compenssate you for it. </p>
    
    <p>The following are some currently outstanding bounties, related to areas that I would like to solve or substantially improve.</p>
  
    <p>[Please note that I am the final arbiter of whether a solution satisifes any given bounty. I'm offering this in good faith, but there's a definite possiblility that y
      you'll offer some solution that I deem to "not count", for some reason.] </p>
  
    <p><b>$1000</b> - Any intervention that can <i>significantly</i> imporve my personal learning rate, especially at understanding and assimilating technical / mathmatical concepts. 
    This should either be objectively verifiable, or if subjective, such a strong a effect that am impressed that it is significant. I'll give partial bounties for less impressive 
    inovations.</p>
      
    <!--<p><em>$500<em> - Any intervention by which I can lower my physiological arousal, as measured by GSR, from X to Y, in under Z minutes.</p>-->
    
    <p><b>$2000</b> - Introduce me to someone that I end up dating for more than a year.
